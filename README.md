The "Global Bank Loan Default Analysis" delves into the complexities of loan defaults, a key aspect of financial risk management. This project investigates various client and loan characteristics to identify the factors that significantly influence loan defaults at Global Bank.

Key insights from the analysis include:
- Loan amounts are not significant indicators of the likelihood of default.
- Credit-related factors such as derogatory reports and debt-to-income ratios are more closely associated with loan defaults.
- The purpose of a loan, particularly in the case of debt consolidation, is a critical factor with a higher default rate.

These findings are crucial for institutions like Global Bank, suggesting a refocus in risk assessment models towards the borrower's credit history and the loan's purpose. By refining loan approval criteria, Global Bank can enhance its lending strategies and risk management approach.
