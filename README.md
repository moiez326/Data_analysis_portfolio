The "Global Bank Loan Default Analysis" delves into the complexities of loan defaults, a key aspect of financial risk management. This project investigates various client and loan characteristics to identify the factors that significantly influence loan defaults at Global Bank.

Key insights from the analysis include:
- Loan amounts are not significant indicators of the likelihood of default.
- Credit-related factors such as derogatory reports and debt-to-income ratios are more closely associated with loan defaults.
- The purpose of a loan, particularly in the case of debt consolidation, is a critical factor with a higher default rate.

I suggest a refocus in risk assessment models towards the borrower's credit history and the loan's purpose. By refining loan approval criteria, Global Bank can enhance its lending strategies and risk management approach.

The "Shinkansen Passenger Satisfaction Analysis" project explores the crucial aspects influencing passenger satisfaction on Japan's renowned bullet train. This analysis is centred on understanding the diverse elements contributing to the overall travel experience.

Key findings from the study include:
- Service quality and onboard amenities have a more substantial influence on satisfaction than travel distance and delays.
- Demographic factors like age and gender significantly impact satisfaction levels, with varying satisfaction observed in elderly and younger passenger groups.
- The quality of onboard services, such as comfort, catering, and entertainment, emerges as key drivers of passenger satisfaction.

These insights are vital for the travel industry, particularly for services like the Shinkansen. Enhancing service quality and customizing the travel experience to cater to diverse passenger needs can lead to significant improvements in satisfaction rates. Tailoring services to different demographic groups could be a strategic approach to boosting overall passenger satisfaction.
